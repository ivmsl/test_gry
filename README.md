*   Uninvited triangle in the city of sqares 
*   
*   This project is a take on a primitive game, 
*   in which player controls a small triangle trying
*   to dodge squares falling from the sky.
*
*   The goal is to dodge as many squares as it is possible.
*   If player collides with a square, the game ends.
*
*   This is a project created as a part of a university course.
*   (SiNWO, UÅš). It uses Codeium and TabNine AI agents 
*   to test their capabilities (as a part of the university task).

*   Project uses SDL2, SDL2_TTF libs.
